## Why

Due to the pandemic and recent popularity of commuting on bike, many bike shops are swamped with large bike repair orders. At the same time, cyclists drop off their bikes for repairs with a wait time of over a week without knowing when their bike will be ready. This app will bridge the gap between both shop owners and cyclists for fast efficient communication. Along with The Bike Shop, cyclist will be able to see what is going on in the community, events, and local trails.

## Who are we?

We love working on web developement and riding our bikes. During our cohort, we found that riding our bikes was a great way to stay fit and mentally sharp!
